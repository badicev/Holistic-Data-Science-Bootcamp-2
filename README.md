*Earthquakes over the World and in Turkey*

This repository contains a project that aims to analyze and visualize earthquake data over the world and in Turkey. The project uses earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which provides real-time and historical earthquake data through an API.

*Results*

The project generates various plots that provide insights into earthquake data over the world and in Turkey. Some of the key results are:

* The frequency of earthquakes over the world has been increasing over the past century, but the number of large earthquakes (magnitude > 7) has remained relatively constant.
* Turkey is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, with several major earthquakes (magnitude > 7) occurring in the past century.
* The distribution of earthquake magnitudes over the world and in Turkey follows a power-law distribution, with a few large earthquakes and many small earthquakes.


*Future Work*

The project could be extended in several ways, such as:
* Analyzing the correlation between earthquakes and other factors, such as tectonic plates, fault lines, and geological features.
* Using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood and severity of earthquakes.
